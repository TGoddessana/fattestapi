## About the FattestAPI, what is it and why was it created?

---

### Short story

FattestAPI is a framework built on top of two giants: FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
It was developed with the goal of building the fattest way to write REST APIs.

### Little longer story

Originally, I was a big fan of Flask - in fact, the framework was called Fullask REST Framework before it was renamed.
It was a project that was developed with the intention of reducing duplication in projects by putting enough of the
idiomatic code provided by Django and the Django REST Framework on top of a micro-framework called Flask.

However, after struggling with API documentation, I found a great framework called FastAPI and decided to migrate to it.

The idiom code was heavily inspired by one of my favorite frameworks, the Django REST Framework, and the Repository and
Service code was heavily inspired by Spring Data JPA.
