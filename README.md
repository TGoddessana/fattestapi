## About FattestAPI

## What is it and why was it developed?

The FattestAPI package is built on top of the excellent Python web framework, FastAPI, and the widely-used
object-relational mapper, SQLAlchemy. It was developed with the goal of providing the "fattest way" to build REST APIs
by offering commonly used boilerplate code.

In fact, I was an avid fan of the Flask web framework, and I still love it. In fact, the initial name of this package
was Fullask-REST-framework, and it was developed with the intention of extending the micro web framework Flask with
batteries included.

However, while developing REST APIs using Flask, I encountered difficulties in documenting the APIs using Swagger. Of
course, you can achieve documentation using excellent frameworks like:

- Flask-Smorest, which supports OpenAPI 3.0 with Flask and marshmallow
- Flask-RESTx, which supports OpenAPI 3.0 also

And it's **definitely not**  that these packages are inadequate. But I wanted a framework that takes an even better
approach
to documentation, and that's when I came across the fantastic package, FastAPI. So, I decided to migrate the existing
framework based on FastAPI.
It was inspired by the excellent and widely-used web frameworks such as Django and Django REST Framework, Spring and
Spring Data Projects, and NestJS.

## Goals of FattestAPI

FattestAPI aims to achieve the following:

* Provide pre-built boilerplate code for commonly performed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it
  easy for developers to handle them.
* Support Layered Architecture by officially supporting Controller, Service, and Repository, making it easier for
  developers to achieve separation of concerns.
* Support an authentication system.
* Provide commonly used utility codes.
